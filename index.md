## About Accessibility for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities

Cognitive and learning disabilities impact how people process information. For example, they can affect people's perception, memory, language, attention, problem solving, and comprehension. Terminology for categories and conditions varies, and includes intellectual disabilities, developmental disabilities; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, dementia, dyslexia, and more.

Technology provides opportunities for people to interact with content and to process information in ways that are more usable to them. For example, people can:
* navigate web content using different strategies
* access information in text, audio, or other formats
* change the presentation of the content according to their individual needs or preferences

There are many things that designers and developers can do to:
*  avoid accessibility barriers that exclude people from using their products
* optimize the user experience of people with cognitive and learning disabilities

Specific examples of cognitive and learning disabilities and of accessibility barriers are in this section of "How People with Disabilities Use the Web: Diverse Abilities and Barriers": **[Cognitive and learning](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/abilities-barriers/#cognitive)**.

## Cognitive Accessibility in W3C Standards

Existing and developing standards from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) address many aspects of cognitive accessibility. For example, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)) includes requirements that address cognitive accessibility. The requirements (called “success criteria”) are in these and other guidelines:

* [Guideline 1.3 Adaptable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/adaptable): Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
* [Guideline 2.2 Enough Time](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/enough-time): Provide users enough time to read and use content.
* [Guideline 2.4 Navigable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/navigable): Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
* [Guideline 3.1 Readable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/readable): Make text content readable and understandable.
* [Guideline 3.2 Predictable](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/predictable): Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
* [Guideline 3.3 Input Assistance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/input-assistance): Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

Additional guidance on cognitive accessibility is include in the WCAG Understanding documents and Techniques, including Advisory Techniques. These documents are introduced in a section of the WCAG Overview: [What is in the WCAG 2 Documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#whatis2).

## Additional Support for Cognitive Accessibility

Some cognitive accessibility user needs are not addressed in existing W3C standards.

W3C is actively working to provide additional guidance on cognitive accessibility, including:

* developing "supplemental guidance" beyond what fits into accessibility standards now
* developing potential additional requirements for future versions of accessibility standards
* developing standards for personalization, which is a key aspect of cognitive accessibility

### Supplemental Guidance

The document [Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/) is for people who make Web content (Web pages) and Web applications. It gives advice and on how to make content usable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. It has content about:

- people with learning and cognitive disabilities,
- aims and objectives for usable content,
- design patterns (ways) to make content usable,
- including users in design and testing activities, and
- personas (examples) and user needs.
 
 ### Potential Additional Requirements in Standards
 
WCAG 2.2 is currently being develeped and includes several potential “success criteria” with an emphasis on cognitive accessibility. These may become part of the final publication, depending on the outcome of the public Wide Review process that W3C standards undergo.

## Cognitive Accessibility Work at W3C

Current work on cognitive accessibility at W3C WAI is mostly focused in the following Task Forces under the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group ([AG WG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/)) and the Accessible Platform Architectures ([APA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/)) Working Group:

* [Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/) &mdash; Resources in development are listed in the [wiki main page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page).
* [Personalization Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/task-forces/personalization/) &mdash; Resources in development are introduced in the [Personalization Overview]( https://deploy-preview-2--wai-personalization-standards.netlify.com/standards-guidelines/personalization/)<!-- @@ update link -->.

### Get Updates, Get Involved

To get notices of opportunities for review and comment on WAI documents, see [Get WAI News](https://www.w3.org/WAI/news/subscribe/).

Opportunities for contributing to cognitive accessibility and other WAI work are introduced in [Participating in WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/participating/).
